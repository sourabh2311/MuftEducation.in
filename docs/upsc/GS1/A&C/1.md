BCE (Before Common / Current Era) = BC (Before Christ)

CE (Common / Current Era) = AD (Anno Domini, year of the Lord)

BP (Before the Present) is the number of years before the present. Because the present changes every year, archaeologists, by convention, use A.D. 1950 as their reference. So, 2000 B.P. is the equivalent of 50 B.C.
